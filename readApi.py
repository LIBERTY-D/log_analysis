import  requests#Module which allows  you to send HTTP requests using Python.
import sys#The sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment. It allows operating on the interpreter as it provides access to the variables and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. Letâ€™s consider the below example.
